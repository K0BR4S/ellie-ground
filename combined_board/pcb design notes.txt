Done
-taking out the wago connector sensors 

To Do
-decide how many HX711s we're going to need 
-are we keeping/using relay board?
-how many flow meters 
-how many servo connectors, how do we protec them
-power source?
-how many lipos? 
-Potential data logger: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12772 Are we still trying to collect any data or leaving that to recovery?
	-other people have had luck with the miccroSD breakout board we're using https://www.adafruit.com/product/254 using SPI communication 
-doesnt seem like using a blackbox is very common, microsd's seem to be most popular and probably have better guidelines online 
	-check in on what exactly went wrong with the SD card last time
